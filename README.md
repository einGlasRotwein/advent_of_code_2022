# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 in `R`.
This is my 3rd AoC; in 2020, I got 31 stars; in 2021, I got 33 stars.
Let's see whether I can manage at least 35 this year :-)

Follow me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@juli_nagel), where I will post about my solutions as well!
